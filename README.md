# An exploration of Text to Speech using a sequence to sequence transformer

An exploration of creating a text to speech model that uses a sequence to sequence
architecture with an encoding transformer model and decoding transformer model with cross attention.

Audio is converted into tokens using Meta's Encodec. At the moment due to limited time
and money budget this only works with the very first seconds of audio and it is WIP.
